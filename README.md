#Learn JavaScript part 4 - Conditional statements

Read below for instructions on completing the coding challenge:

This app, mission control, is built to manage the missle
defense system of no particular country on no particular planet. 

If a missle threat is detected, the guard needs to be able to 
quickly enter the direction the threat is coming from: North, 
East, South or West, and the level of the threat.  

Each side, for example North, is protected by 12 silos.  Silos
1 - 12 are for the North, 13 - 24 for the Easy, 25 - 36 for the 
South, and 37 - 48 for the West.  Each threat level requires 3 silos to
be used. 

So, if the threat is from the North with a threat level of 1, then 
Silos 1 through 3 are activated! 
should be displayed on the screen.  There is a div with an id of 
display for this purpose.  
If the threat is from the North with a threat level of 4, then 
Silos 1 through 12 are activated!
should be displayed. 
If the threat is from the South with a threat level of 3, then
Silos 25 through 33 are activated!
should be displayed.  

There are of course many ways to accomplish this, and as this is a 
beginner javascript course, the main goal here is not to write the 
best and cleanest code, but to get the job done, and write code that is
easy to understand.  

The goal of this challenge is to practice what you've learned from 
Learn JavaScript part 4 on namelesshacker.com.  This lesson is about 
conditional statements: if, if else, else.

Most of the code is set up for you.  You'll need to check to see if the 
variable is North, and if so then you'll need to check if it is threat level 1, 
level 2, level 3, and so on...

To give you a good idea, the first few lines of the conditional logic have been 
written for you.
